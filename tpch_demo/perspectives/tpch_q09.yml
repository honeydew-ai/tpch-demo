  Product Type Profit Measure Query (Q9)

  This query determines how much profit is made on a given line of parts, broken
  out by supplier nation and year.


  Business Question

  The Product Type Profit Measure Query finds, for each nation and each year,
  the profit for all parts ordered in that year that contain a specified
  substring in their names and that were filled by a supplier in that nation.
  The profit is defined as the sum of [(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) -
  (ps_supplycost * l_quantity)] for all lineitems describing parts in the
  specified line. The query lists the nations in ascending alphabetical order
  and, for each nation, the year and profit in descending order by year (most
  recent first).
