  Minimum Cost Supplier Query (Q2)  
   This query finds which supplier should be selected to place an order for a given part in a given region.


  Business Question 

  The Minimum Cost Supplier Query finds, in a given region, for each part of a
  certain type and size, the supplier who can supply it at minimum cost. If
  several suppliers in that region offer the desired part type and size at the
  same (minimum) cost, the query lists the parts from suppliers with the 100
  highest account balances. For each supplier, the query lists the supplier's
  account balance, name and nation; the part's number and manufacturer; the
  supplier's address, phone number and comment information.
