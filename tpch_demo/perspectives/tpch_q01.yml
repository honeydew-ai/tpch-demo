  Business Question


  The Pricing Summary Report Query provides a summary pricing report for all
  lineitems shipped as of a given date. The date is within 60 - 120 days of the
  greatest ship date contained in the database. The query lists totals for
  extended price, discounted extended price, discounted extended price plus tax,
  average quantity, average extended price, and average discount. These
  aggregates are grouped by RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS, and listed in ascending
  order of RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS. A count of the number of lineitems in each
  group is included.
