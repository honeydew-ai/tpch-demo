  Customer Distribution Query (Q13) 

  This query seeks relationships between customers and the size of their orders.


  Business Question

  This query determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders
  they have made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or
  present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many
  have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not
  fall into one of several special categories of orders. Special categories are
  identified in the order comment column by looking for a particular pattern.
