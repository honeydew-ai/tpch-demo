  Small-Quantity-Order Revenue Query (Q17)  

  This query determines how much average yearly revenue would be lost if orders
  were no longer filled for small quantities of certain parts. This may reduce
  overhead expenses by concentrating sales on larger shipments. 


  Business Question 

  The Small-Quantity-Order Revenue Query considers parts of a given brand and
  with a given container type and determines the average lineitem quantity of
  such parts ordered for all orders (past and pending) in the 7-year database.
  What would be the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if
  orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were
  no longer taken?
